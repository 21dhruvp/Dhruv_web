		`<li><b>Playing my Saxophone</b></li>
			<p>I LOVE playing my saxophone. I always need to get better so I play my saxophone everyday. I play both the Baritone And Alto Saxophone.</p>
			<li><b>Marching Band</b></li>
			<p>I really like marching band because, well marching band. It's really fun to play ou instrument and march drill sets. After you are done multiple strenuous hours of work to get both the music, and the drill memorized; Then, you do your first show of the season, You feel SO accomplished. There is, of course, always something you can do to make yourself and/or the band better. So our marching band practices every week in the fall on Mondays and Wednesdays.</p>
